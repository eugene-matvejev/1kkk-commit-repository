## how to use
```
./ultimate-commit-machine.sh
```

## purposes of repository
 * I am quite curious, is there is any 'top10|100' commiters in github?
 * discover limitations of github.com
  * so far discovered:
   * 10k commit preview per review
 * SHA1-attack test, example: http://www.itwire.com/security/77024-fallout-webkit-repository-broken-by-sha-1-collision.html
 
 
 local repository has over 1kk commits, I unable to push them, because of limitations, so far no problems
