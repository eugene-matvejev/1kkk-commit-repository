# ULTIMATE COMMIT MACHINE REPOSITORY
_aka 1kkk repository_


## how to use
`$ ./ultimate-commit-machine.sh`

## purposes of repository
 * I am quite curious, if there is any 'top10|100|1000' commiters [of the day] at github?
 * discover limitations of github.com
  * so far discovered:
    * 10k commits preview per pull request preview [28.02.2017]
    * seems like you can't push more than 500k commits per single push [28.02.2017]

* SHA1-attack test, example: http://www.itwire.com/security/77024-fallout-webkit-repository-broken-by-sha-1-collision.html
